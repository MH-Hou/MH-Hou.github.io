I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam), working at both the [Social AI Group](https://socialai.nl/) and the [Computational Intelligence Group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) under the supervision of [Dr. Kim Baraka](https://www.kimbaraka.com/), [Prof. Koen Hindriks](https://koenhindriks.eu/), and [Prof. A.E. Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/). Before joining VU Amsterdam, I spent one year as a full-time robotics researcher at [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/). I received my M.S. degree from the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/about/rankings) in 2020 and my B.E. degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/facts_figures/list.htm) in 2018.

[//]: # (Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit]&#40;http://reddit.com&#41;. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.)

[//]: # (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)

[//]: # (Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons]&#40;https://fontawesome.com/&#41; and [Academicons]&#40;https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/&#41;, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.)
